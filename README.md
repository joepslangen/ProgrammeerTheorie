# itnroduction 

Rush hour is originally played in a 6x6 grid
The grid is displayed with several cars which have a size of 2 or three grid positions
It is not possible for the cars to overlap or be (partly) outside the grid 
The orientation of the cars is either vertical or horizontal
Cars can only be moved one at a time and only in empty spaces
The goal of the game is to move the targeted car to the exit of the grid which is located near the center of the right edge of the grid.
